***********************************************************************

ResNet Utility (RU) is a small program written for a university
computer support department. It's main function is to provide quick 
access to commonly used system information and provides access to 
various OS tools and utilities to reduce repetitive keystrokes and/or 
mouse movements.

The program is divided into tabs that correspond to different sets of 
features. The main tab is mostly to provide as much information about 
the current system as possible, while providing other resources 
(buttons) to provide quick access to frequently used programs or 
utilities.
